I wanted to try my hands on this and get more fluent with `linear-gradient`.
Since I'm working with react a lot lately I decided to bend the rules in the sense that I'll use JavaScript
to generate the css using styled-components.
However I shall not use JavaScript to perform any runtime calculations or measurements to achieve my goals.
